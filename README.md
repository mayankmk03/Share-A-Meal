# Share-A-Meal
Share-A-Meal is a web-based platform that aims to reduce food waste and support the needy by connecting food donors with food banks and charities. The website will allow users to register as either a food donor or a recipient, and they can create and browse donation requests based on the type and quantity of food available. The platform will also have a rating system to ensure the quality of the donated food and a pickup and delivery service to make the process more convenient for both donors and recipients. With Share-A-Meal, we aim to bridge the gap between food waste and hunger and make a positive impact in our community.

# Problem Statement
Food waste is a major issue globally, with an estimated one-third of all food produced going to waste each year. At the same time, millions of people face hunger and food insecurity, with many unable to access nutritious meals regularly. While many organizations and individuals donate food to charities and food banks, there is often a disconnect between the food donors and the recipients, resulting in inefficiencies and missed opportunities to address the problem. Additionally, the current pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity and has made it difficult for individuals and organizations to donate food safely and efficiently. Therefore, there is a need for a web-based platform that can connect food donors with charities and food banks, streamline the donation process, and ensure that surplus food reaches those in need. The Share-A-Meal project aims to address this issue by creating a user-friendly, secure, and efficient web-based platform that facilitates food donations and reduces food waste while supporting those in need.
